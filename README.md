ls1-MarDyn Overview
===================

ls1-MarDyn is a massively parallel Molecular Dynamics (MD) code for large systems. Its main target is the simulation of thermodynamics and nanofluidics. ls1-MarDyn is designed with a focus on performance and easy extensibility.


Getting Started
===============

Documentation:
--------------
The current doxygen documentation can be found here:
https://www5.in.tum.de/mardyn/doxygen_doc/html/

Prerequisites:
--------------
### mandatory requirements:
* a C++11 compiler (GCC, Clang, Intel, PGI, Cray, NEC SX, IBM XL, ...)
* a working MPI installation compatible with the MPI 3.0 specification or later (Open MPI, MPICH, MVAPICH, Intel MPI, Cray MPI, NEC MPI, IBM Platform MPI, ...)

### optional requirements:
* FFTW3: <http://www.fftw.org>
* VTK: <http://www.vtk.org>
* QuickSched: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05384>


Installation (make)
------------

### Installing ls1-MarDyn using make

ls1-MarDyn is build from source code using GNU make or alternatively using cmake (see below).

A default build using the GNU compiler and a MPI library providing the mpicxx compiler wrapper is done with
```sh
  cd src
  make
```
To get an overview of options to control the build process, e.g. to use another compiler, disable MPI, ... run
```sh
  make help
```
To see a list of all supported target platforms and compilers call
```sh
  make cfg_list
```
and run then make with the desired configuration:
```sh
  make CFG=<config name>
```
To display further information about the available suboptions for a configuration use
```sh
  make CFG=<cfg name> cfg_help
```

### Installing ls1-MarDyn using cmake

#### Configuration
Initial support to build ls1-mardyn using cmake has been recently added.
To build mardyn using cmake first create an additional directory on the root mardyn directory and change into that directory.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
Next, cmake has to be executed. In most cases, you will have to specify the compiler with which mardyn should be built:
```bash
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..
# or using mpi:
CC=`which mpicc` CXX=`which mpicxx` cmake ..
```
Specifying the compiler is only possible at the first execution of cmake.
If you want to change the compiler later on, either add another build directory, or first clear the existing build directory.

To configure the options within ls1-mardyn it is recommended to use `ccmake`:
```bash
ccmake .
```
That way you can easily edit the available options.

Finally, build ls1-mardyn using:
```bash
make
``` 
For a parallel and faster build please use `make`'s `-j` parameter with an appropriate number of tasks.

Running ls1-MarDyn
------------------
The basic command to run ls1-mardyn is as follows:
```sh
MarDyn [options] <inputfile>
```
where MarDyn is the executable build in the INSTALLATION section, `[options]` are any "--"-prefixed options as listed by `MarDyn --help` and `<inputfile>` is a input file.

Detailed help can be obtained by running
```sh
MarDyn --help
```
### running examples
ls1-MarDyn comes with a set of examples, which can be found in the examples folder.
```sh
cd examples/EOX/305K_liq
mpirun -np 2 ../../../src/MarDyn config.xml  --steps 10
```
optional: to make the simulation aware of time limits like on a compute node, which should stop the simulation even if the desired amount of steps is not reached use ```loop-abort-time``` in (s) in XML or CLI:
```sh
mpirun -np 2 ../../../src/MarDyn config.xml  --steps 10 --loop-abort-time 3600
```

AutoPas Support
------------------
ls1 mardyn supports AutoPas as a replacement for the used linked cells container and the built-in force calculation.

### Building for AutoPas 
To enable support for AutoPas (<https://github.com/AutoPas/AutoPas/>), you will have to enable the option `ENABLE_AUTOPAS`.

### Running using AutoPas
To use AutoPas a few modifications to the normal `xml` config files have to be performed:
- The `datastructure` section has to be changed to type `AutoPas`.
- If inside of the `datastructure` section no additional information is given AutoPas will run without auto-tuning and a linked cells container (rebuild frequency = 1, skin = 0).
- Multiple further options can be specified for AutoPas.
  For a quick overview check config_autopas_allOptions.xml in the Argon example directory.
  Additional information for the options can be found at: <https://www5.in.tum.de/AutoPas/doxygen_doc/master/namespaceautopas_1_1options.html> 
  and within the readXML method of <https://www5.in.tum.de/mardyn/doxygen_doc/html/classAutoPasContainer.html>

### Limitations
- Using AutoPas, currently, only single-centered Lennard-Jones interactions are possible.
