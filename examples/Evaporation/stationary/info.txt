sim01: equilibrate liquid phase
  |--run01: small liquid phase for system creation, liquid reservoir
  |--run02: scale up (enlarge cross-sectional area) => reservoir for scale up systems
  
sim02: evaporation into vacuum
  |--run01: start nemd sim. with const. feed rate to populate vapor phase
  |--run02: restart from run01, update feed rate by MettDeamonFeedrateDirector
  |--run03: restart from run02, scale up (enlarge cross-sectional area) => enhance statistics
  
sim03: evaporation with counter pressure
  |--run01: start nemd sim. with const. feed rate to populate vapor phase
  |--run02: restart from run01, update feed rate by MettDeamonFeedrateDirector
  |--run03: restart from run02, scale up (enlarge cross-sectional area) => enhance statistics
