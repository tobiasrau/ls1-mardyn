Summary of Plugins in Trunk
---------------------------

Since the number of plugins is expected to grow quite rapidly, the following table provides a list of the currently available plugins. It is intended to prevent duplication of reimplementing features, which already exist in other Plugins.

Plugin name  | Up to 5 Keywords | Short Description (one line)
------------- | ------------- | --
CavityWriter | cavity, output, profile, grid | Sets up a grid of pseudo-molecules that check for neighbours in radius. Threshold determines if grid point counts as cavity or not. Output in .xyz format.
CheckpointWriter | checkpoint, legacy | (Legacy) Checkpoint writer. Hint: use <type>binary</type> to speed-up. See also MPICheckpointWriter and MPI_IOCheckpointWriter.

DecompWriter | mpi, print | Writes information on the MPI Domain Decomposition. For each rank the boxmin and boxmax is printed.
DensityProfileWriter | todo | todo
DistControl | distance, interface, density profile, quasi-stationary, reference coordinates | Determines vapor-liquid interface positions from density profile. The positions can be used as reference coordinates for e.g. sampling regions in quasi-stationary evaporation simulations.

ODF | orientation distribution function | Calculates the distribution of mutual orientations between dipolar molecules and writes them into an output. Always use dipolar vector [0 0 1] in the input when using this plugin. Only tested for molecules with exactly one dipole site. Application to other molecules should be possible with minor adjustments and some testing.
